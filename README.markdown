Bourgeois Bits
==============

This repository holds the corporate homepage of [Bourgeois Bits](http://bourgeoisbits.com/)

Because of how the [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) feature works, the actual content for the website is in the `gh-pages` branch of this repository.

To get to this branch, do:

    git checkout -b gh-pages origin/gh-pages
    
Once you're set up, you can make changes to the directory, commit them all by doing `git commit -a`, and then push them up to GitHub by doing `git push origin gh-pages`.
